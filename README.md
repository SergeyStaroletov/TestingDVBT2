DVB-T2 Test Dialog based on Kaffeine
===================

Original player code forked from <a href="https://github.com/KDE/kaffeine">Kaffeine KDE project</a>

Integrates Qt plot widget, GIS map from the Mission Planner project, and RTL-SDR. See <a href = "src/dvbtest">src/dvbtest</a>

It uses Kaffeine classes to work with transponders and a DVB card (tested only with Astrometa/Sony). 

It can constantly show signal strench/quality, scan spectrum, draw a map with points and visualize constellations.

!!Currently source state works only in a demo mode!!

Presented at TELFOR 2021.

Please wait for updates.

For plotting, it uses QCustomPlot, a modern plotting widget for Qt by Emanuel Eichhammer.
