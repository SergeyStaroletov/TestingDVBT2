DVB Test Dialog based on Kaffeine
===================

Integrates qt plot widget, map from the mission planner project, and rtl-sdr.

It uses Kaffeine classes to work with transponders and a DVB card (tested only with Astrometa/Sony). 

It can scan spectrum, draw a map with points and visualize constellations.

Currently source state is to work only in a demo mode.
